  <h1>The ODST Helmet - 7/20/24 </h1>
<p>Research continues. These updates will NOT be daily. Today we decided to use a standard jumpsuit as a sensor testbed rather than having a custom fitted one produced.</p>
<p>Right now we are just focusing on putting pen to paper and designing pieces. It will be a few months until we have a prototype ready. I will publish more updates as we get more done.</p>
<p>A late night thought... We could implement "artificial muscles" to augment strength and add a "armor lock" feature in case it's on display, or we have to lock it down.</p>
<p>This has been a late night thought.</p>
